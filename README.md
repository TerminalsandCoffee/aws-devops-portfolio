# AWS DevOps Portfolio 

> Production-Grade Cloud Engineering • Terraform • GitHub Actions • AWS ECS/EKS • Observability • DR & Resilience

This portfolio is a collection of hands-on **AWS DevOps projects** that demonstrate end-to-end automation using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), and containerized workloads (ECS Fargate & EKS).  

Each project follows the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** and mirrors real-world, production environments — complete with remote state management, monitoring, and security best practices.

### 📁 Projects Overview  

| # | Project | Core Tools | JD Keywords Hit |
|---|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 01 | **Containerized Flask App on ECS Fargate** | Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions, ECR | ECS, ALB, IAM, CloudWatch |
| 02 | **EKS Observability Stack** | Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana | EKS, Observability, Monitoring |
| 03 | **GitOps-Powered App on EKS with ArgoCD** | ArgoCD, GitHub Actions, Helm, Terraform | GitOps, CI/CD, Kubernetes Deployments |

### Portfolio Highlights  
- **IaC:** 100% Terraform — modular, reusable, and environment-scoped  
- **CI/CD:** Automated via GitHub Actions (plan/apply workflows)  
- **Containers:** ECS Fargate workloads with ECR-based image builds  
- **Observability:** CloudWatch logs, alarms, and dashboards integrated  
- **Security:** Scoped IAM roles, encrypted resources, least privilege  
- **Remote State:** S3 backend + DynamoDB locking (no local drift)

### Vision  
Build a growing series of **modular DevOps blueprints** that demonstrate practical automation skills for real-world AWS environments — from single-service pipelines to full platform stacks.
