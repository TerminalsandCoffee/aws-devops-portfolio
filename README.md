# AWS DevOps Portfolio 

> Production-Grade Cloud Engineering • Terraform • GitHub Actions • AWS ECS/EKS • Observability • DR & Resilience

This portfolio is a collection of hands-on **AWS DevOps projects** that demonstrate end-to-end automation using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), and containerized workloads (ECS Fargate & EKS).  

Each project follows the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** and mirrors real-world, production environments — complete with remote state management, monitoring, and security best practices.

### Portfolio Highlights  
- **IaC:** 100% Terraform — modular, reusable, and environment-scoped  
- **CI/CD:** Automated via GitHub Actions with reusable workflows for consistency across projects  
- **Security:** Shift-left security with `tfsec` scanning, scoped IAM roles, encrypted resources, and least privilege  
- **Containers:** ECS Fargate workloads with ECR-based image builds and automated deployments  
- **Observability:** CloudWatch logs, alarms, and dashboards integrated  
- **Remote State:** S3 backend + DynamoDB locking for team collaboration (no local drift)  
- **Runbooks:** Production-ready operational runbooks for critical migrations and cutover procedures

### Vision  
Build a growing series of **modular DevOps blueprints** that demonstrate practical automation skills for real-world AWS environments — from single-service pipelines to full platform stacks.
